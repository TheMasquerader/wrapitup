# Wrap it up!

Wrap it up is a web application that allows you to time track speakers, forums, meetings or anything else via a series of color indicators. Simply set the duration of the expected time frame, select a time frame for the caution indicator to display and you are on your way. This was inspired by helping host forums. I realized that timers themselves are visually daunting and cause to much focus to be placed on a timer. Colored cues create awareness without overwhelming the speaker about time.

## Admin Panel
There are two times to set.
- The duration in minutes
- When to caution, 5, 2 or 1 minute.

## Visual Cues
When its solid green, just keep talking. When it turns yellow and flashes three times it's almost time to wrap it up. Once it goes red it will continue to flash until you reset the application by hitting the reset button at the bottom left.  You can reset at any point and the timer will stop.
